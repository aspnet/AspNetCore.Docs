# Tutorial: Create Entity Framework 6 Code First data model using MVC 5

> [!NOTE]
> For new development, we recommend [ASP.NET Core Razor Pages](/aspnet/core/razor-pages) over ASP.NET MVC controllers and views. For a tutorial series similar to this one using Razor Pages, see [Tutorial: Get started with Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start). The new tutorial:
> * Is easier to follow.
> * Provides more EF6 Core best practices.
> * Uses more efficient queries.
> * Is more current with the latest API.
> * Covers more features.
> * Is the preferred approach for new application development.

In this article, you learn how to create ASP.NET MVC 5 data model applications using Entity Framework (EF) 6 and Visual Studio. This tutorial uses the Code First workflow. For information about how to choose between Code First, Database First, and Model First, see [Create a model](/ef/ef6/modeling/).

This tutorial series explains how to build the Contoso University sample application. The sample application is a simple university website. With it, you can view and update student, course, and instructor information. Here are a few of the screens you create:

![Edit Student](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image2.png)

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an MVC web app
> * Set up the site style
> * Install Entity Framework 6
> * Create the data model
> * Create the database context
> * Initialize DB with test data
> * Set up EF6 to use LocalDB
> * Create controller and views
> * View the database

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2017)

* [Entity Framework 6](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework)

* [Windows Azure SDK 2.2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=323510) (optional)

## Create an MVC web app

1. Open Visual Studio and create a new C# web project using the **ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)** template. Name the project *ContosoUniversity* and select **OK**.

   ![New Project dialog box in Visual Studio](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/new-project-dialog.png)

1. In **New ASP.NET Project - ContosoUniversity**, select **MVC**.

   ![New web app dialog box in Visual Studio](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/new-web-app-dialog.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, the **Authentication** option is set to **No Authentication**. For this tutorial, the web app doesn't require users to sign in, nor does it restrict access based on who's signed in.

1. Select **OK** to create the project.

## Set up the site style

A few simple changes set up the site menu, layout, and home page.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, open **Views** > **Shared** > *_Layout.cshtml*.

1. Replace the code in the *_Layout.cshtml* file with this code:

   [!code-cshtml[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample1.cshtml?highlight=6,19,24-27,38)]

    The code you copied into the file:

    * Changed each occurrence of `My ASP.NET Application` and `Application name` to `Contoso University`.

    * Added menu entries for `Students`, `Courses`, `Instructors`, and `Departments`

    * Deleted the `Contact` menu entry.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, open **Views** > **Home** > *Index.cshtml*

1. Replace the code in the *Index.cshtml* file with this code:

   [!code-cshtml[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample2.cshtml)]

1. From the menu bar, select **File** > **Save All**

1. Press **F5** to run the project.

    A browser window opens and the Conostco University home page appears.

## Install Entity Framework 6

This step is one of a few steps in this tutorial that you have to do manually. You could have installed EF6 automatically using the ASP.NET MVC scaffolding feature. You're doing it manually so you can see the steps required to use EF6. You'll use scaffolding later to create the MVC controller and views.

1. From the **Tools** menu, select **NuGet Package Manager**, and then select **Package Manager Console**.

1. In the **Package Manager Console** window, enter this command:

   ```console
   Install-Package EntityFramework
   ```

## Create the data model

Next you create entity classes for the Contoso University application. Start with these three entities:

![Class_diagram](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image8.png)

There's a one-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Enrollment` entities, and there's a one-to-many relationship between `Course` and `Enrollment` entities. In other words, a student can be enrolled in any number of courses, and a course can have any number of students enrolled in it.

In the following sections, you create a class for each one of these entities.

> [!NOTE]
> If you try to compile the project before you finish creating all of these entity classes, you recieve compiler errors.

### The Student entity

![Student_entity](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image9.png)

In the **Models** folder, create a class file named *Student.cs*.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click **Models** and select **Add** > **Class**.

1. Name the class *Student* and add it to the project.

1. Replace the code in the *Student.cs* class file with this code:

   [!code-csharp[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample3.cs)]

1. Save the file.

The `ID` property becomes the primary key column of the database table that corresponds to this class. By default, EF6 interprets a property that's named `ID` or *classname* `ID` as the primary key.

The `Enrollments` property is a *navigation property*. Navigation properties hold other entities that are related to this entity. In this case, the `Enrollments` property of a `Student` entity holds all of the `Enrollment` entities that are related to that `Student` entity. In other words, if a given `Student` row in the database has two related `Enrollment` rows (rows that contain that student's primary key value in their `StudentID` foreign key column), that `Student` entity's `Enrollments` navigation property contains those two `Enrollment` entities.

Navigation properties are typically defined as `virtual` so that they can take advantage of certain EF6 functionality such as *lazy loading*. Lazy loading is  explained in the [Reading Related Data](reading-related-data-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application.md) tutorial later in this series.

If a navigation property can hold multiple entities (as in many-to-many or one-to-many relationships), its type must be a list in which entries can be added, deleted, and updated, such as `ICollection`.

### The Enrollment entity

![Enrollment_entity](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image10.png)

In the **Models** folder, create a class file named *Enrollment.cs*.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click **Models** and select **Add** > **Class**.

1. Name the class *Enrollment* and add it to the project.

1. Replace the code in the *Enrollment.cs* class file with this code:

   [!code-csharp[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample4.cs)]

1. Save the file.

The `EnrollmentID` property is the primary key. This entity uses the *classname* `ID` pattern instead of `ID` by itself as you saw in the `Student` entity. Ordinarily you would choose one pattern and use it throughout your data model. Here, the variation illustrates that you can use either pattern. In a later tutorial, you'll see how using `ID` without `classname` makes it easier to implement inheritance in the data model.

The `Grade` property is an [enum](/ef/ef6/modeling/code-first/data-types/enums). The question mark after the `Grade` type declaration indicates that the `Grade` property is [nullable](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/using-nullable-types). A grade that's null is different from a zero grade â€” null means a grade isn't known or hasn't been assigned yet.

The `StudentID` property is a foreign key, and the corresponding navigation property is `Student`. An `Enrollment` entity is associated with one `Student` entity, so the property can only hold a single `Student` entity (unlike the `Student.Enrollments` navigation property you saw earlier, which can hold multiple `Enrollment` entities).

The `CourseID` property is a foreign key, and the corresponding navigation property is `Course`. An `Enrollment` entity is associated with one `Course` entity.

EF6 interprets a property as a foreign key property if it's named *&lt;navigation property name&gt;&lt;primary key property name&gt;* (for example, `StudentID` for the `Student` navigation property since the `Student` entity's primary key is `ID`). Foreign key properties can also be named the same simply *&lt;primary key property name&gt;* (for example, `CourseID` since the `Course` entity's primary key is `CourseID`).

### The Course entity

![Course_entity](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image11.png)

In the **Models** folder, create a class file named *Course.cs*.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click **Models** and select **Add** > **Class**.

1. Name the class *Course* and add it to the project.

1. Replace the code in the *Course.cs* class file with this code:

   [!code-csharp[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample5.cs)]

1. Save the file.

The `Enrollments` property is a navigation property. A `Course` entity can be related to any number of `Enrollment` entities.

The `<xref:System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema.DatabaseGeneratedAttribute>` attribute is explained in a later tutorial in this series. Basically, this attribute lets you enter the primary key for the course rather than having the database generate it.

## Create the database context

The main class that coordinates EF6 functionality for a given data model is the *database context* class. You create this class by deriving from the [System.Data.Entity.DbContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entity.dbcontext(v=vs.113).aspx) class. In your code, you specify which entities are included in the data model. You can also customize certain EF6 behavior. In this project, the class is named `SchoolContext`.

Create a folder in the ContosoUniversity project.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and select **Add** > **New Folder**.

1. Name the folder *DAL* for Data Access Layer.

1. Right-click **DAL** and select **Add** > **Class**.

1. Name the class *SchoolContext* and add it to the project.

1. Replace the code in the *SchoolContext.cs* class file with this code:

   [!code-csharp[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample6.cs)]

1. Save the file.

### Specify entity sets

This code creates a [DbSet](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entity.dbset(v=vs.113).aspx) property for each entity set. In EF6 terminology, an *entity set* typically corresponds to a database table, and an *entity* corresponds to a row in the table.

> [!NOTE]
> You can omit the `DbSet<Enrollment>` and `DbSet<Course>` statements and it would work the same. EF6 would include them implicitly because the `Student` entity references the `Enrollment` entity and the `Enrollment` entity references the `Course` entity.

### Specify the connection string

The name of the connection string (which you'll add to the Web.config file later) is passed in to the constructor.

[!code-csharp[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample7.cs?highlight=1)]

You could also pass in the connection string itself instead of the name of one that is stored in the Web.config file. For more information about options for specifying the database to use, see [Connection strings and models](/ef/ef6/fundamentals/configuring/connection-strings).

If you don't specify a connection string or the name of one explicitly, EF6 assumes that the connection string name is the same as the class name. The default connection string name in this example would then be `SchoolContext`, the same as what you're specifying explicitly.

### Specify singular table names

The `modelBuilder.Conventions.Remove` statement in the [OnModelCreating](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entity.dbcontext.onmodelcreating(v=vs.103).aspx) method prevents table names from being pluralized. If you didn't do this, the generated tables in the database would be named `Students`, `Courses`, and `Enrollments`. Instead, the table names are `Student`, `Course`, and `Enrollment`. Developers disagree about whether table names should be pluralized or not. This tutorial uses the singular form, but the important point is that you can select whichever form you prefer by including or omitting this line of code.

## Initialize DB with test data

EF6 can automatically create (or drop and re-create) a database for you when the application runs. You can specify that this should be done every time your application runs or only when the model is out of sync with the existing database. You can also write a `Seed` method that EF6 automatically calls after creating the database in order to populate it with test data.

The default behavior is to create a database only if it doesn't exist (and throw an exception if the model has changed and the database already exists). In this section, you specify that the database should be dropped and re-created whenever the model changes. Dropping the database causes the loss of all your data. This is generally okay during development, because the `Seed` method runs when the database is re-created and re-creates your test data. But in production you generally don't want to lose all your data every time you need to change the database schema. Later you'll see how to handle model changes by using Code First Migrations to change the database schema instead of dropping and re-creating the database.

### Database Creation

1. Right-click **DAL** and select **Add** > **Class**.

1. Name the class *SchoolInitializer* and add it to the project.

1. Replace the code in the *SchoolInitializer.cs* class file with this code:

    [!code-csharp[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample8.cs)]

    This code causes a database to be created when needed and loads test data into the new database.

1. Save the file.

The `Seed` method takes the database context object as an input parameter, and the code in the method uses that object to add new entities to the database. For each entity type, the code creates a collection of new  entities, adds them to the appropriate `DbSet` property, and then saves the changes to the database. It isn't necessary to call the `SaveChanges` method after each group of entities, as is done here, but doing that helps you locate the source of a problem if an exception occurs while the code is writing to the database.

## Web.config update

To tell EF6 to use your initializer class, add an element to the `entityFramework` element in the application *Web.config* file.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click the `WebConfig` file.

1. Copy the highlighted `<contexts>` block in this code sample:

   [!code-xml[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample9.xml?highlight=2-6)]

    > [!NOTE]
    >Information the user should notice even if skimming(Make sure you update the *Web.config* file in the root project folder. There's also a *Web.config* file in the *Views* subfolder. You don't need to update that one.

1. Paste it into the *<entityFramework>* element.

1. Save the file.

The `context type` specifies the fully qualified context class name and the assembly it's in, and the `databaseinitializer type` specifies the fully qualified name of the initializer class and the assembly it's in.

> [!NOTE]
> When you don't want EF6 to use the initializer, you can set an attribute on the `context` element: `disableDatabaseInitialization="true"`.) For more information, see [Configuration File Settings](/ef/ef6/fundamentals/configuring/config-file).

The application is now set up so that when you access the database for the first time in a given run of the application, EF6 compares the database to the model (your `SchoolContext` and entity classes). If there's a difference, the application drops and re-creates the database.

> [!NOTE]
> When you deploy an application to a production web server, you must remove or disable code that drops and re-creates the database. A later tutorial in this series covers this topic.

## Set up EF6 to use LocalDB

[LocalDB](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-2016-express-localdb?view=sql-server-2017) is a lightweight version of the SQL Server Express database engine. It's easy to install and configure, starts on demand, and runs in user mode. LocalDB runs in a special execution mode of SQL Server Express that enables you to work with databases as *.mdf* files. You can put LocalDB database files in the *App\_Data* folder of a web project if you want to be able to copy the database with the project. The user instance feature in SQL Server Express also enables you to work with *.mdf* files, but the user instance feature is deprecated; therefore, LocalDB is recommended for working with *.mdf* files. LocalDB is installed by default with Visual Studio.

Typically, SQL Server Express is not used for production web applications. LocalDB in particular is not recommended for production use with a web application because it's not designed to work with IIS.

### Add the connectionString

1. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click the `WebConfig` file.

1. Copy the highlighted `<connectionStrings>` block in this code sample:

   [!code-xml[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample10.xml?highlight=1-3)]

    > [!NOTE]
    >Information the user should notice even if skimming(Make sure you update the *Web.config* file in the root project folder. There's also a *Web.config* file in the *Views* subfolder. You don't need to update that one.

1. Paste it between the `<configSections>` and `<appSettings>` elements.

1. Save the file.

The connection string you've added specifies that EF6 uses a LocalDB database named *ContosoUniversity1.mdf*. The database doesn't exist yet. EF6 creates it.) If you want to create the database in your *App\_Data* folder, you could add `AttachDBFilename=|DataDirectory|\ContosoUniversity1.mdf` to the connection string. For more information about connection strings, see [SQL Server Connection Strings for ASP.NET Web Applications](/previous-versions/aspnet/jj653752(v=vs.110)).

You don't actually need a connection string in the *Web.config* file. If you don't supply a connection string, EF6 uses a default connection string based on your context class. For more information, see [Code First to a New Database](/ef/ef6/modeling/code-first/workflows/new-database).

## Create controller and views

Now you create a web page to display data. The process of requesting the data automatically triggers the creation of the database. Begin by creating a new controller. But, before you do that, build the project to make the model and context classes available to MVC controller scaffolding.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click **Controllers** and select **Add** > **New Scaffolded Item**.

1. In **Add Scaffold**, select **MVC 5 Controller with views, using Entity Framework**.

1. Select **Add**. the **Add Controller** dialog box appears.

1. In **Add Controller**, make the following selections:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Model class | Select **Student (ContosoUniversity.Models)**. If you don't see this option in the drop-down list, press **F5** to build the project and try again. |
    | Data context class | Select **SchoolContext (ContosoUniversity.DAL)**. |
    | Controller name | Enter **StudentController**. Be careful. Student**s**Controller is automatically populated in the **Controller name** field. Make sure you edit it to make **Students** singular|

    Leave the default values for the other fields.

1. Select **Add**

When you select **Add**, the scaffolder creates a *StudentController.cs* file and a set of views (*.cshtml* files) that work with the controller. In the future when you create projects that use EF6, you can also take advantage of some additional functionality of the scaffolder: create your first model class, don't create a connection string, and then in the **Add Controller** box specify **New data context** by selecting the **+** button next to **Data context class**. The scaffolder creates your `DbContext` class and your connection string as well as the controller and views.

Visual Studio opens the *Controllers\StudentController.cs* file. You see that a class variable has been created that instantiates a database context object:

     [!code-csharp[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample11.cs)]

     The `Index` action method gets a list of students from the *Students* entity set by reading the `Students` property of the database context instance:

     [!code-csharp[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample12.cs)]

     The *Student\Index.cshtml* view displays this list in a table:

     [!code-cshtml[Main](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample13.cshtml)]

1. Press **F5** to run the project. (If you get a "Cannot create Shadow Copy" error, close the browser and try again.)

     Click the **Students** tab to see the test data that the `Seed` method inserted. Depending on how narrow your browser window is, you see the Student tab link in the top address bar or you have to select the upper right corner to see the link.

     ![Menu button](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image14.png)

     ![Student Index page](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image15.png)

## View the database

When you ran the Students page and the application tried to access the database, EF6 discovered that there was no database and created one. EF6 then ran the seed method to populate the database with data.

You can use either **Server Explorer** or **SQL Server Object Explorer** (SSOX) to view the database in Visual Studio. For this tutorial, you use **Server Explorer**.

1. Close the browser.

1. In **Server Explorer**, expand **Data Connections** (you may need to select the refresh button first), expand **School Context (ContosoUniversity)**, and then expand **Tables** to see the tables in your new database.

    ![Database tables in Server Explorer](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image16.png)

1. Right-click the **Student** table and select **Show Table Data** to see the columns that were created and the rows that were inserted into the table.

    ![Student table](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/table-data.png)

1. Close the **Server Explorer** connection.

The *ContosoUniversity1.mdf* and *.ldf* database files are in the *%USERPROFILE%* folder.

Because you're using the `DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges` initializer, you could now make a change to the `Student` class, run the application again, and the database would automatically be re-created to match your change. For example, if you add an `EmailAddress` property to the `Student` class, run the Students page again, and then look at the table again, you see a new `EmailAddress` column.

## Conventions

The amount of code you had to write in order for EF6 to be able to create a complete database for you is minimal because of *conventions*, or assumptions that EF6 makes. Some of them have already been noted or were used without your being aware of them:

* The pluralized forms of entity class names are used as table names.

* Entity property names are used for column names.

* Entity properties that are named `ID` or *classname* `ID` are recognized as primary key properties.

* A property is interpreted as a foreign key property if it's named *&lt;navigation property name&gt;&lt;primary key property name&gt;* (for example, `StudentID` for the `Student` navigation property since the `Student` entity's primary key is `ID`). Foreign key properties can also be named the same simply &lt;primary key property name&gt; (for example, `EnrollmentID` since the `Enrollment` entity's primary key is `EnrollmentID`).

You've seen that conventions can be overridden. For example, you specified that table names shouldn't be pluralized, and you'll see later how to explicitly mark a property as a foreign key property. You'll learn more about conventions and how to override them in the [Creating a More Complex Data Model](creating-a-more-complex-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application.md) tutorial later in this series. For more information about conventions, see [Code First Conventions](/ef/ef6/modeling/code-first/conventions/built-in).

## Summary
