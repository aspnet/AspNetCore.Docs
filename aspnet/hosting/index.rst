Hosting

By `Sourabh Shirhatti`

The hosting docs provide an overview of the features on ASP.NET 5. Hosters who offer ASP.NET hosting will be able to use the setup and configuration recommendations to integrate ASP.NET 5 into their hosting solution. This document should also serve as a guide for any enviroment where multiple discrete users will be running web sites on a single server or web farm.
