# Before you open an issue

If the issue is related to an ASP.NET Core document, open the issue with the **This page** feedback button and form at the bottom of that document page. When you use the **This page** feedback form:

* The issue automatically receives tracking metadata.
* The author of that topic automatically receives a notification.

If the issue is:

* A simple typo or similar correction, you can submit a pull request (PR). See [the contributor guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/#quick-edits-to-existing-documents) for instructions.
* A general support or coding question, ask on a support channel, such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions), [ASP.NET Core Slack](http://tattoocoder.com/aspnet-slack-sign-up/), or [ASP.NET Gitter](https://gitter.im/aspnet/Home). Our workload on the documentation usually prevents us from answering general requests for assistance.
* A site design concern, create an issue at [MicrosoftDocs/Feedback](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Feedback/issues/new/choose).
* A problem completing a tutorial, compare your code with the completed sample.
* A duplicate of an open issue, leave a comment on that issue.
* A duplicate of a closed issue or related to a closed PR, open a new issue from the bottom of the document page and cross-reference the original issue or PR in the opening comment.

*Please don't comment on closed issues and PRs. Cross-link the closed issue/PR on a new issue.*
