# Kestrel server for ASP.NET Core

By [Tom Dykstra](http://github.com/tdykstra), [Chris Ross](https://github.com/Tratcher), and [Stephen Halter](https://twitter.com/halter73)

Kestrel is a cross-platform [web server for ASP.NET Core](overview.md) based on [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv), a cross-platform asynchronous I/O library. Kestrel is the web server that is included by default in ASP.NET Core new-project templates. 

Kestrel supports the following features:

  * HTTPS
  * Opaque upgrade used to enable [WebSockets](https://github.com/aspnet/websockets)
  * Unix sockets for high performance behind Nginx 

Kestrel is supported on all platforms and versions that .NET Core supports.

## When to use Kestrel with a reverse proxy

If your application accepts requests only from an internal network, you can use Kestrel by itself.

If you expose your application to the Internet, we recommend that you use IIS, Nginx, or Apache as a *reverse proxy server*. A reverse proxy server receives HTTP requests from the Internet and forwards them to Kestrel after some preliminary handling.

The most important reason for using a reverse proxy for edge deployments (exposed to traffic from the Internet) is security. Kestrel is relatively new and does not yet have a full complement of defenses against attacks. This includes but isn't limited to appropriate timeouts, size limits, and concurrent connection limits.

Another scenario that requires a reverse proxy is when you have multiple applications that share the same port running on a single server. That doesn't work with Kestrel directly because Kestrel doesn't support host-header routing. When you configure Kestrel to listen on a port, it handles all traffic for that port regardless of host header.

Even if a reverse proxy server isn't required, you can use one to improve performance. A reverse proxy can let you offload some work from your application server, such as serving static content, and it can cache and compress responses. A reverse proxy can also simplify load balancing and SSL set-up -- only your reverse proxy server requires an SSL certificate, and that server can communicate with your application servers on the internal network using plain HTTP.

## How to use Kestrel in ASP.NET Core apps

Install the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel/) NuGet package.

Call the [`UseKestrel`](http://docs.asp.net/projects/api/en/latest/autoapi/Microsoft/AspNetCore/Hosting/WebHostBuilderKestrelExtensions/index.html#Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WebHostBuilderKestrelExtensions.UseKestrel.md) extension method on `WebHostBuilder` in your `Main` method, specifying any [Kestrel options](https://docs.asp.net/projects/api/en/latest/autoapi/Microsoft/AspNetCore/Server/Kestrel/KestrelServerOptions/) that you need, as shown in the following example:

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/sample/Program.cs?name=snippet_Main&highlight=13-19)]

### URL prefixes

By default Kestrel binds to `http://localhost:5000`. You can configure URL prefixes and ports for Kestrel to listen on by using the `UseURLs` extension method, the `server.urls` command-line argument, or the ASP.NET Core configuration system. For more information about these methods, see [Hosting](../../fundamentals/hosting.md). For information about how URL binding works when you use IIS as a reverse proxy, see [ASP.NET Core Module](aspnet-core-module.md). 

URL prefixes for Kestrel can be in any of the following formats. 

* IP address with port number

  ````none
  http://65.55.39.10:80/
  https://65.55.39.10:443/
  ````

  Address 0.0.0.0 is a special case that binds to all IP addresses.


* IPV6 address with port number

  ````none
  http://[0:0:0:0:0:ffff:4137:270a]:80/ 
  https://[0:0:0:0:0:ffff:4137:270a]:443/ 
  ````

* Host name with port number

  ````none 
  http://contoso.com:80/
  http://*:80/
  https://contoso.com:443/
  https://*:443/
  ````

  Any host name other than `localhost` has the same effect as IP 0.0.0.0: it binds to all traffic on the specified port. It makes no difference whether the host name is an actual name or contains wildcards. If you need to bind different host names to different ASP.NET Core applications on the same port, use a reverse proxy server such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache.

* "Localhost" host name or IP, with port number

  ````none
  http://localhost:5000/
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  http://[::1]:5000/
  ````

  When `localhost` is specified, Kestrel tries to bind to both IPv4 and IPv6 loopback interfaces. If the requested port is in use by another service on either loopback interface, Kestrel fails to start. If either loopback interface is unavailable for any other reason (most commonly because IPv6 is not supported), Kestrel logs a warning. 

* Localhost IP with port number 0 (Kestrel dynamically binds to an available port)

  ````none
  http://127.0.0.1:0/
  http://[::1]:0/
  ````

* Unix socket

  ````none
  http://unix:/run/dan-live.sock  
  ````

When you specify port 0, you can use  [`IServerAddressesFeature`](http://docs.asp.net/projects/api/en/latest/autoapi/Microsoft/AspNetCore/Hosting/Server/Features/IServerAddressesFeature/index.html#Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature.md) to determine which port Kestrel actually bound to at runtime, as shown in the following example.

[!code-csharp[](kestrel/sample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_Configure)]

### Url prefixes for SSL

Be sure to include URL prefixes with `https:` if you call the `UseSSL` extension method, as shown below.

````csharp
var host = new WebHostBuilder() 
    .UseKestrel(options => 
    { 
        options.NoDelay = true; 
        options.UseHttps("testCert.pfx", "testPassword"); 
        options.UseConnectionLogging(); 
    }) 
   .UseUrls("http://localhost:5000", "https://localhost:5001") 
   .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()) 
   .UseStartup<Startup>() 
   .Build(); 
````

  The tutorial uses Kestrel by itself locally, then deploys the app to Azure where it runs under Windows using IIS as a reverse proxy server.
