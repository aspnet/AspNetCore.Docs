#Microsoft.AspNetCore.All metapackage for ASP.NET Core 2.x

This feature requires ASP.NET Core 2.x.

The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage for ASP.NET Core includes all:

* Supported packages by for ASP.NET Core.
* Supported packages by for Entity Framework Core. 
* Internal and 3rd-party dependencies used by ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. 

All the features of ASP.NET Core 2.x and Entity Framework Core 2.x are included in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.All](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All) package. The default project templates use this package.

The version number of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage represents the ASP.NET Core version and Entity Framework Core version (aligned with the .NET Core version).

Applications that use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage automatically take advantage of the .NET Core Runtime Store. The Runtime Store contains all the runtime assets needed to run ASP.NET Core 2.x applications. When you use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage, **no** assets from the referenced ASP.NET Core NuGet packages are deployed with the application &mdash; the .NET Core Runtime Store contains these assets. The assets in the Runtime Store are precompiled to improve application startup time.

Features you donâ€™t use in your application are removed by package trimming. Unused features are excluded in published application output.

The following *.csproj* file references the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` metapackage for ASP.NET Core:
