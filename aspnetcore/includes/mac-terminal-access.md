# Accessing a Command Terminal on Visual Studios for Mac
Accessing a command terminal on Mac for the first time requires some simple setting configurations.
> * Go to **System Preferences>Keyboard>Shortcuts>Services**.
> * Under **Files and Folders**, make sure **New Terminal at Folder** is selected.

From then on, you will be able to access a command terminal two ways: from inside **Visual Studios** or from **Finder**.  

#### To access a command terminal from Visual Studios:
> * Right click the project name.
> * Go to **Tools>Open in Terminal**.

#### To access a command terminal from Finder:
> * Right click the desired folder.
> * At the very bottom of the list, select **New Terminal at Folder**.
