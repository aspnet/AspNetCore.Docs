> [!NOTE]
> Prior to ASP.NET Core 3.0 any web application will write one log of type `LogLevel.Warning` per request if the requested culture is unsupported, which is trouble and make the logs huge over the time. This behavior has been changed in ASP.NET 3.0 and the `RequestLocalizationMiddleware` will write a log of type `LogLevel.Debug` instead to reduce the amount of logs in production.
