# What's new in ASP.NET Core 3.1

This article highlights the most significant changes in ASP.NET Core 3.1 with links to relevant documentation.

Razor components are now generated as partial classes. Code for a Razor component can be written using a code-behind file defined as a partial class rather than defining all the code for the component in a single file. For more information, see [Partial class support](xref:blazor/components#partial-class-support)
