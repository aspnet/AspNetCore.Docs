# Migrate from ASP.NET Core 5.0 to 6.0

This article explains how to update an existing ASP.NET Core 5.0 project to ASP.NET Core 6.0.

## Prerequisites

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-prereqs-vs-6.0.md)]

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-prereqs-vsc-6.0.md)]

# [Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-mac)

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/net-prereqs-mac-6.0.md)]

## Update .NET SDK version in global.json

If you rely upon a [global.json](/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file to target a specific .NET SDK version, update the `version` property to the .NET 6.0 SDK version that's installed. For example:

```diff
{
  "sdk": {
-    "version": "5.0.100"
+    "version": "6.0.100-preview.2.21155.3"
  }
}
```

## Update the target framework

Update the project file's [Target Framework Moniker (TFM)](/dotnet/standard/frameworks) to `net6.0`:

```diff
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
-    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
+    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

## Update package references

In the project file, update each [Microsoft.AspNetCore.*](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.AspNetCore.*) and [Microsoft.Extensions.*](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Microsoft.Extensions.*) package reference's `Version` attribute to 6.0.0 or later. For example:

```diff
<ItemGroup>
-    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch" Version="5.0.3" />
-    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions" Version="5.0.0" />
+    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch" Version="6.0.0-preview.2.*" />
+    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions" Version="6.0.0-preview.2.*" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Update Docker images

For apps using Docker, update your *Dockerfile* `FROM` statements and scripts. Use a base image that includes the ASP.NET Core 6.0 runtime. Consider the following `docker pull` command difference between ASP.NET Core 5.0 and 6.0:

```diff
- docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0
+ docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0
```

## Changes to the ASP.NET Core Razor SDK

The Razor compiler now leverages the new [source generators feature](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/) to generated compiled C# files from the Razor views and pages in a document. In previous versions:

* The compilation relied on an individual `RazorGenerate` and `RazorCompile` target to produce the generated code. These targets are no longer valid. In .NET 6, both code generation and compilation are supported by a single call to the compiler.
* A separate Razor assembly was generated that contained the compiled view types in an application. This behavior has been deprecated and a single assembly is produced that contains both the app types and the generated views.

Make the following changes:

* Remove all the targets listed under `Targets`. `RazorComponentGenerateDependsOn` is still supported to specify dependencies that are required before the build runs.
* Under `Properties` add the `EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles` property to the element. When `EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles` is set to `true`, the generated source files are written to disk. Setting to `true` is useful when debugging the compiler. The default is `false`.
* Under `Properties`, remove the following properties from the element as they are no longer applicable with the single-step compilation model.
  * `RazorTargetAssemblyAttribute`
  * `RazorTargetName`
  * `EnableDefaultRazorTargetAssemblyInfoAttributes`
  * `UseRazorBuildServer`

## Review breaking changes

For breaking changes from .NET 5.0 to .NET 6.0, see [Breaking changes for migration from version 5.0 to 6.0](/dotnet/core/compatibility/6.0). ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core are also included in the list.
