# Using Browser Link

<a name=using-browserlink></a>

By [Nicol√≤ Carandini](https://github.com/ncarandini)

Browser Link is a feature in Visual Studio that creates a communication channel between the development environment and one or more web browsers. You can use Browser Link to refresh your web application in several browsers at once, which is useful for cross-browser testing.
