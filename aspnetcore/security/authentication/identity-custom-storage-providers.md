# Custom storage providers for ASP.NET Core Identity

By [Steve Smith](http://ardalis.com)

ASP.NET Core Identity is an extensible system which enables you to create your own storage provider and plug it into your application without re-working the application. This topic describes how to create a customized storage provider for ASP.NET Core Identity. It covers the important concepts for creating your own storage provider, but is not a step-by-step walkthrough.

[View or download sample from GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/security/authentication/identity/sample).

## Introduction

By default, the ASP.NET Core Identity system stores user information in a SQL Server database, and uses Entity Framework Core to create the database. For many applications, this approach works well. However, you may prefer to use a different type of persistence mechanism, such as [Azure Table Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/), or you may already have database tables with a very different structure than the default implementation. In either case, you can write a customized provider for your storage mechanism and plug that provider into your application.

ASP.NET Core Identity is included in application templates in Visual Studio when the "Individual User Accounts" option is chosen:

![Choose indvidual accounts when creating new project in Visual Studio to add Identity](identity-custom-storage-providers/_static/individual-accounts.png)

When using the dotnet CLI, you can include ASP.NET Core Identity by adding the -au or --auth option and specifying Individual:

```
dotnet new mvc -au Individual
dotnet new webapi -au Individual
```

## Understand the architecture

ASP.NET Core Identity consists of classes called managers and stores. *Managers* are high-level classes which an application developer uses to perform operations, such as creating a user, in the ASP.NET Core Identity system. *Stores* are lower-level classes that specify how entities, such as users and roles, are persisted. Stores follow the [repository pattern](http://deviq.com/repository-pattern/) and are closely coupled with the persistence mechanism, but managers are decoupled from stores which means you can replace the persistence mechanism without disrupting the entire application.

The following diagram shows how your web application interacts with the managers, and stores interact with the data access layer.

![ASP.NET Core Apps work with Managers (for example, UserManager, RoleManager). Managers work with Stores (for example, UserStore) which communicate with a Data Source using a library like Entity Framework Core.](identity-custom-storage-providers/_static/identity-architecture-diagram.png)

To create a custom storage provider for ASP.NET Core Identity, you have to create the data source, the data access layer, and the store classes that interact with this data access layer (the green and grey boxes in the diagram above). You can continue using the same managers to perform data operations on the user, and the same application code that interacts with these managers (the blue boxes above).

You do not need to customize the manager classes because when creating a new instance of UserManager or RoleManager you provide the type of the user class and pass an instance of the store class as an argument. This approach enables you to plug your customized classes into the existing structure. You will see how to instantiate UserManager and RoleManager with your customized store classes in the section [Reconfigure application to use new storage provider](#reconfigure-app-to-use-new-storage-provider).

## Understand the data that is stored

To implement a custom storage provider, you should understand the types of data used with ASP.NET Core Identity. This will help you decide which features are relevant to your application. ASP.NET Core stores details about the four different data types shown below.

### Users

Registered users of your web site, including the user Id and user name. May include a hashed password if users log in with credentials that are specific to your site (rather than using credentials from an external site like Facebook), and security stamp to indicate whether anything has changed in the user credentials. May also include email address, phone number, whether two factor authentication is enabled, the current number of failed logins, and whether an account has been locked.

### User Claims

A set of statements (or claims) about the user that represent the user's identity. Can enable greater expression of the user's identity than can be achieved through roles.

### User Logins

Information about the external authentication provider (like Facebook) to use when logging in a user.

### Roles

Authorization groups for your site. Includes the role Id and role name (like "Admin" or "Employee").

## Create the data access layer

This topic assumes you are familiar with the persistence mechanism that you are going to use and how to create entities for that mechanism. This topic does not provide details about how to create the repositories or data access classes; instead, it provides some suggestions about the design decisions you need to make when working with ASP.NET Core Identity.

You have a lot of freedom when designing the data access layer for a customized store provider. You only need to create persistence mechanisms for features that you intend to use in your application. For example, if you are not using roles in your application, you do not need to create storage for roles or user role associations. Your technology and existing infrastructure may require a structure that is very different from the default implementation of ASP.NET Core Identity. In your data access layer, you provide the logic to work with the structure of your storage implementation.

In the data access layer, you provide the logic to save the data from ASP.NET Core Identity to your data source. The data access layer for your customized storage provider might include the following classes to store user and role information.

### Context class

Encapsulates the information to connect to your persistence mechanism and execute queries. This class is central to your data access layer. The other data classes will require an instance of this class to perform their operations. You will also initialize your store classes with an instance of this class.

### User Storage

Stores and retrieves user information (such as user name and password hash).

### Role Storage

Stores and retrieves role information (such as the role name).	

### UserClaims Storage

Stores and retrieves user claim information (such as the claim type and value).

### UserLogins Storage

Stores and retrieves user login information (such as an external authentication provider).	

### UserRole Storage

Stores and retrieves which roles are assigned to which users.

[!TIP] Only implement the classes you intend to use in your app.

In the data access classes, you provide code to perform data operations for your particular persistence mechanism. For example, within a custom SQL Server implementation accessed using Dapper, you might have the following code to create a new user:



## Customize the user class

When implementing your own storage provider, you must create a user class which is equivalent to the [`IdentityUser` class](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/api/microsoft.aspnet.identity.corecompat.identityuser).

At a minimum your user class must include an `Id` and a `UserName` property.

The `IUser` interface defines the properties that the `UserManager` attempts to call when performing requested operations. The interface contains two properties: `Id` and `UserName`. The type of the `Id` property is always a string. The framework expects the storage implementation to handle data conversions if necessary.

The `IdentityUser` class implements `IUser` and contains any additional properties or constructors for users on your web site.

## Customize the user store

You also create a UserStore class that provides the methods for all data operations on the user. This class is equivalent to the [UserStore<TUser>](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.identity.entityframeworkcore.userstore-1) class. In your UserStore class, you implement `IUserStore<TUser>` and any of the optional interfaces. You select which optional interfaces to implement based on on the functionality you wish to provide in your application.

### Optional interfaces

- IUserRoleStore
- IUserClaimStore
- IUserPasswordStore
- IUserSecurityStampStore
- IUserEmailStore
- IPhoneNumberStore
- IQueryableUserStore
- IUserLoginStore
- IUserTwoFactorStore
- IUserLockoutStore

All of these optional interfaces inherit from `IUserStore`.

The following example shows a simple user store class. The TUser generic parameter takes the type of your user class which usually is the `IdentityUser` class you defined.

(show high level view of a UserStore class)

Within your `UserStore` class, you use the data access classes that you created to perform operations. These are passed in using dependency injection. For example, in the Azure Table Storage implementation, the `UserStore` class has the `CreateAsync` method which uses an instance of `UserTable` to insert a new record.

```c#
public async virtual Task<IdentityResult> CreateAsync(TUser user, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
{
	cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
	ThrowIfDisposed();

	if (user == null)
	{
		throw new ArgumentNullException("user");
	}
	((Model.IGenerateKeys)user).GenerateKeys();

	try
	{

		List<Task> tasks = new List<Task>(2);
		tasks.Add(_userTable.ExecuteAsync(TableOperation.Insert(user)));

		if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(user.Email))
		{
			Model.IdentityUserIndex index = CreateEmailIndex(user.Id.ToString(), user.Email);
			tasks.Add(_indexTable.ExecuteAsync(TableOperation.InsertOrReplace(index)));
		}

		await Task.WhenAll(tasks.ToArray());
		return IdentityResult.Success;
	}
	catch (AggregateException aggex)
	{
		aggex.Flatten();
		return IdentityResult.Failed(new IdentityError()
        { Code = "001", Description = "User Creation Failed." });
	}
}
```

### Interfaces to implement when customizing user store

- **IUserStore**  
 The [IUserStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613278(v=vs.108).aspx) interface is the only interface you must implement in your user store. It defines methods for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving users.
- **IUserClaimStore**  
 The [IUserClaimStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613265(v=vs.108).aspx) interface defines the methods you must implement in your user store to enable user claims. It contains methods or adding, removing and retrieving user claims.
- **IUserLoginStore**  
 The [IUserLoginStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613272(v=vs.108).aspx) defines the methods you must implement in your user store to enable external authentication providers. It contains methods for adding, removing and retrieving user logins, and a method for retrieving a user based on the login information.
- **IUserRoleStore**  
 The [IUserRoleStore&lt;TKey, TUser&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613276(v=vs.108).aspx) interface defines the methods you must implement in your user store to map a user to a role. It contains methods to add, remove, and retrieve a user's roles, and a method to check if a user is assigned to a role.
- **IUserPasswordStore**  
 The [IUserPasswordStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613273(v=vs.108).aspx) interface defines the methods you must implement in your user store to persist hashed passwords. It contains methods for getting and setting the hashed password, and a method that indicates whether the user has set a password.
- **IUserSecurityStampStore**  
 The [IUserSecurityStampStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613277(v=vs.108).aspx) interface defines the methods you must implement in your user store to use a security stamp for indicating whether the user's account information has changed. This stamp is updated when a user changes the password, or adds or removes logins. It contains methods for getting and setting the security stamp.
- **IUserTwoFactorStore**  
 The [IUserTwoFactorStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613279(v=vs.108).aspx) interface defines the methods you must implement to implement two factor authentication. It contains methods for getting and setting whether two factor authentication is enabled for a user.
- **IUserPhoneNumberStore**  
 The [IUserPhoneNumberStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613275(v=vs.108).aspx) interface defines the methods you must implement to store user phone numbers. It contains methods for getting and setting the phone number and whether the phone number is confirmed.
- **IUserEmailStore**  
 The [IUserEmailStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613143(v=vs.108).aspx) interface defines the methods you must implement to store user email addresses. It contains methods for getting and setting the email address and whether the email is confirmed.
- **IUserLockoutStore**  
 The [IUserLockoutStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613271(v=vs.108).aspx) interface defines the methods you must implement to store information about locking an account. It contains methods for getting the current number of failed access attempts, getting and setting whether the account can be locked, getting and setting the lock out end date, incrementing the number of failed attempts, and resetting the number of failed attempts.
- **IQueryableUserStore**  
 The [IQueryableUserStore&lt;TUser, TKey&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613267(v=vs.108).aspx) interface defines the members you must implement to provide a queryable user store. It contains a property that holds the queryable users.

You implement the interfaces that are needed in your application; such as, the IUserClaimStore, IUserLoginStore, IUserRoleStore, IUserPasswordStore, and IUserSecurityStampStore interfaces as shown below.

```csharp
public class UserStore : IUserStore<IdentityUser, int>,
                         IUserClaimStore<IdentityUser, int>,
                         IUserLoginStore<IdentityUser, int>,
                         IUserRoleStore<IdentityUser, int>,
                         IUserPasswordStore<IdentityUser, int>,
                         IUserSecurityStampStore<IdentityUser, int>
{
    // interface implementations not shown
}
```

### IdentityUserClaim, IdentityUserLogin, and IdentityUserRole

The Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework namespace contains implementations of the [IdentityUserClaim](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613250(v=vs.108).aspx), [IdentityUserLogin](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613251(v=vs.108).aspx), and [IdentityUserRole](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613252(v=vs.108).aspx) classes. If you are using these features, you may want to create your own versions of these classes and define the properties for your application. However, sometimes it is more efficient to not load these entities into memory when performing basic operations (such as adding or removing a user's claim). Instead, the backend store classes can execute these operations directly on the data source. For example, the UserStore.GetClaimsAsync() method can call the userClaimTable.FindByUserId(user.Id) method to execute a query on that table directly and return a list of claims.

## Customize the role class

When implementing your own storage provider, you must create a role class which is equivalent to the IdentityRole class.

The IRole interface defines the properties that the RoleManager attempts to call when performing requested operations. The interface contains two properties - Id and Name. The Id property is a string value.

The following example shows an IdentityRole class that implements IRole.

```csharp
public class IdentityRole : IRole
{
    public IdentityRole() { ... }
    public IdentityRole(string roleName) { ... }
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

## Customize the role store

You also create a RoleStore class that provides the methods for all data operations on roles. This class is equivalent to the RoleStore<TRole> class. In your RoleStore class, you implement the IRoleStore<TRole> and optionally the IQueryableRoleStore<TRole> interface.

The following example shows a role store class. The TRole generic parameter takes the type of your role class which usually is the IdentityRole class you defined.

```csharp
public class RoleStore : IRoleStore<IdentityRole>
{
    public RoleStore() { ... }
    public RoleStore(ExampleStorage database) { ... }
    public Task CreateAsync(IdentityRole role) { ... }
    public Task DeleteAsync(IdentityRole role) { ... }
    public Task<IdentityRole> FindByIdAsync(string roleId) { ... }
    public Task<IdentityRole> FindByNameAsync(string roleName) { ... }
    public Task UpdateAsync(IdentityRole role) { ... }
    public void Dispose() { ... }
}
```

- **IRoleStore&lt;TRole&gt;**  
 The [IRoleStore](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn468195.aspx) interface defines the methods to implement in your role store class. It contains methods for creating, updating, deleting and retrieving roles.
- **RoleStore&lt;TRole&gt;**  
 To customize RoleStore, create a class that implements the IRoleStore interface. You only have to implement this class if want to use roles on your system. The constructor that takes a parameter named *database* of type ExampleDatabase is only an illustration of how to pass in your data access class. For example, in the MySQL implementation, this constructor takes a parameter of type MySQLDatabase.  

## Reconfigure app to use new storage provider

You have implemented your new storage provider. Now, you must configure your application to use this storage provider. If the default storage provider was included in your project, you must remove the default provider and replace it with your provider.

1. Remove the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.EntityFramework.Identity' NuGet package from your web app project.
2. If your storage proder resides in a separate project or package, add a reference to it.
3. Replace all references to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.EntityFramework.Identity' with a using statement for the namespace of your storage provider.
4. In Startup.cs, in the Configure method, change the `AddIdentity` method to use storage classes. You can create your own extension methods for this purpose.

```csharp
// Add Identity services to the services container.
services.AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>()
    //.AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>() // remove default EF implementation
    .AddAzureTableStores<IdentityCloudContext>(new Func<IdentityConfiguration>(() =>
    {
        return new IdentityConfiguration() {
            StorageConnectionString = Configuration.GetValue<string>("IdentityAzureTable:identityConfiguration:storageConnectionString")
        };
    }))
    .AddDefaultTokenProviders();
```
5. If you are using Roles, you must update the RoleManager to use your RoleStore class.
6. If necessary, add connection string or credentials to your app's configuration.
