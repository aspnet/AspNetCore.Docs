# ASP.NET Core Web API help pages using Swagger/Open API

By [Christoph Nienaber](https://twitter.com/zuckerthoben) and [Rico Suter](http://rsuter.com)

Understanding the various methods of an API can be a challenge for a developer when building a consuming app.

Generating good documentation and help pages for your Web API, using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) (a.k.a Open API) with a .NET Core implementation is as easy as adding a couple of NuGet packages and modifying the *Startup.cs*. In this article two popular Swagger .NET implementations are showcased: [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) and [NSwag](https://nswag.org).

* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is a machine-readable description of a RESTful API that enables support for interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability.

* [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) is an open source project for generating Swagger documents for ASP.NET Core Web APIs.

* [NSwag](https://nswag.org) is another open source project for integrating Swagger UI and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) into ASP.NET Core Web APIs, while also offering approaches to generate C# and TypeScript client code for your API.

# What is Swagger/Open API?

Swagger is a specification to describe [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs that is language-agnostic. The Swagger project has been renamed to Open API, so both names can be used interchangeably, but Open API is preferred. It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a service without any direct access to the implementation (source code, network access, documentation). The goal is to minimize the amount of work needed to connect disassociated services and also to reduce the amount of time needed to accurately document a service.

## Swagger specification (swagger.json)

The core to the Swagger flow is the Swagger specification, by default a document named swagger.json. It is generated by the Swagger toolchain (or 3rd party implementations of it) based on your service. It describes the capabilities of your API and how to access it with HTTP. It drives the Swagger UI and is also used by the toolchain to allow for discovery and client code generation. Here is an example of a Swagger specification: 

*The following example is reduced for brevity.*
```json
{
   "swagger": "2.0",
   "info": {
       "version": "v1",
       "title": "API V1"
   },
   "basePath": "/",
   "paths": {
       "/api/Todo": {
           "get": {
               "tags": [
                   "Todo"
               ],
               "operationId": "ApiTodoGet",
               "consumes": [],
               "produces": [
                   "text/plain",
                   "application/json",
                   "text/json"
               ],
               "responses": {
                   "200": {
                       "description": "Success",
                       "schema": {
                           "type": "array",
                           "items": {
                               "$ref": "#/definitions/TodoItem"
                           }
                       }
                   }
                }
           },
           "post": {
               ...
           }
       },
       "/api/Todo/{id}": {
           "get": {
               ...
           },
           "put": {
               ...
           },
           "delete": {
               ...
   },
   "definitions": {
       "TodoItem": {
           "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "id": {
                    "format": "int64",
                    "type": "integer"
                },
                "name": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "isComplete": {
                    "default": false,
                    "type": "boolean"
                }
            }
       }
   },
   "securityDefinitions": {}
}
```

## Swagger UI

Swagger UI offers a web user interface that gives information about the service at hand, using the generated Swagger specification. Both Swashbuckle and NSwag ship with an embedded version of Swagger UI so that it can easily be hosted in your ASP.NET Core application using a simple middleware registration call. The web UI looks like this:

![Swagger UI](web-api-help-pages-using-swagger/_static/swagger-ui.png)

Each public action method in your Controllers can be tested from the UI. Click a method name to expand the section. Add any necessary parameters, and click "Try it out!".

**Note:** The Swagger UI version used for the screenshots is version 2. For a V3 example see [Petstore example](http://petstore.swagger.io/)
